## âœ… FAQ Accordion Behavior Updated!

### ðŸŽ¯ **New Behavior:**
- **Only ONE question can be open at a time** (accordion style)
- **Clicking any question** will:
  - Open that question if it's closed
  - Close that question if it's already open
  - **Automatically close any other open question**

### ðŸ”„ **How It Works:**
1. **Click Question 1** â†’ Question 1 opens
2. **Click Question 3** â†’ Question 1 closes automatically, Question 3 opens
3. **Click Question 3 again** â†’ Question 3 closes
4. **Click Question 5** â†’ Question 5 opens (no other questions are open)

### ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Changes:**
- **Plus icon (+)** when question is closed
- **Minus icon (âˆ’)** when question is open
- **Smooth animation** between open/closed states
- **Only one answer visible** at any time

### ðŸš€ **Test Your FAQ Now:**

The FAQ now behaves exactly like in professional websites where only one section can be expanded at a time, making it cleaner and easier to read.
